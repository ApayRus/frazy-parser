NOTE CHAPTER
title: 1. Prehistory from Gramma
description: Gramma tells a legend about how the World was created.
start: 51

1
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.683
GRAMMA: In the beginning...

2
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.686
there was only ocean...

3
00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:03.815
until the mother island emerged.

4
00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:05.817
Te Fiti.

5
00:01:06.443 --> 00:01:10.196
Her heart held the greatest power ever known.

6
00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:13.324
It could create life itself.

7
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:17.704
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

8
00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:21.374
But in time...

9
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.544
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

10
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:26.838
They believed if they could possess it...

11
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.633
the great power of creation would be theirs.

12
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.178
And one day...

13
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.306
the most daring of them all...

14
00:01:36.473 --> 00:01:40.852
voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.

15
00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:47.025
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:50.069
He was a warrior.

17
00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.572
A trickster.

18
00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.243
A shapeshifter who could change form...

19
00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:01.039
with the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:04.375
And his name...

21
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.420
was Maui.

22
00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:13.218
(CHUCKLES)

23
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.969
(RUMBLING)

24
00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:21.392
But without her heart, Te Fiti began to crumble...

25
00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.312
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

26
00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.374
Maui tried to escape...

27
00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:47.919
but was confronted by another who sought the heart.

28
00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:52.423
Te Kā!

29
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.593
A demon of earth and fire.

30
00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:06.104
Maui was struck from the sky...

31
00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:09.691
never to be seen again.

32
00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:14.946
And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti...

33
00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:17.907
were lost to the sea.

34
00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:20.243
Where, even now...

35
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.370
1,000 years later...

36
00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:25.123
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

37
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.292
still hunt for the heart.

38
00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.796
Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread...

39
00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.257
chasing away our fish...

40
00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:37.635
draining the life from island after island...

41
00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:41.055
until every one of us is devoured...

42
00:03:41.222 --> 00:03:43.892
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

43
00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:46.811
of inescapable death!

44
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.814
(WAILING)

45
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.651
But one day...

46
00:03:53.818 --> 00:03:55.820
the heart will be found...

47
00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:59.073
by someone who will journey beyond our reef...

48
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.575
find Maui...

49
00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:02.827
deliver him across the great ocean...

50
00:04:02.994 --> 00:04:05.163
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

51
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.998
and save us all.

52
00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:09.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

53
00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:10.752
Papa.

54
00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:12.670
No one goes outside the reef.

55
00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:15.924
We are safe here. There is no darkness.

56
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.842
There are no monsters.

57
00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:21.804
Monsters!

58
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.015

- There's no monsters, no monsters...
  -it's the darkness!

59
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:28.186
No, there is nothing beyond our reef, but storms and rough seas.

60
00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:29.479
I'm gonna throw up.

61
00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:31.814
TUI: As long as we stay on our very safe island...

62
00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:33.816
...we'll be fine.

63
00:04:33.983 --> 00:04:35.443
GRAMMA: The legends are true.

64
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.195
Someone will have to go.

65
00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:39.530
TUI: Mother, Motunui is paradise.

66
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.367
Who would want to go anywhere else?

There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

75
00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:22.652
What? I wanna's go back.

76
00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.404
I know, I know. But you don't go out there.

77
00:07:26.322 --> 00:07:27.532
It's dangerous.

78
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.536
Moana, come on.

79
00:07:31.702 --> 00:07:33.704
Let's go back to the village.

80
00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:37.750
You are the next great chief
of our people.

81
00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:40.920
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

82
00:07:41.504 --> 00:07:45.466
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

Make way, make way

85
00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:03.901
Moana, it's time you knew

86
00:08:04.068 --> 00:08:07.822
The village of Motunui is all you need

87
00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:10.074
The dancers are practicing

88
00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:12.577
They dance to an ancient song

89
00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:15.580
Who needs a new song This old one's all we need

90
00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:17.665
This tradition is our mission

91
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.418
And Moana, there's so much to do

92
00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:21.961
Don't trip on the taro root

93
00:08:22.128 --> 00:08:24.255
That's all you need

94
00:08:24.422 --> 00:08:26.382
We share everything we make

95
00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:28.426
We joke and we weave our baskets

96
00:08:28.593 --> 00:08:30.887
The fishermen come back from the sea

97
00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:32.555
I wanna see

98
00:08:32.722 --> 00:08:34.473
Don't walk away

99
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.559
Moana, stay on the ground now

100
00:08:36.726 --> 00:08:38.603
Our people will need a chief

101
00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:40.688

- And there you are
- There you are

102
00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:42.732
There comes a day

103
00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:46.611
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is

104
00:08:46.777 --> 00:08:48.613
Where you are

105
00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:50.364
Consider the coconut

106
00:08:50.573 --> 00:08:52.742

- The what
- Consider its tree

107
00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:56.287
We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need

108
00:08:56.954 --> 00:08:58.915
We make our nets from the fibers

109
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:00.917
The water is sweet inside

110
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:05.213
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

111
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.131
Consider the coconuts

112
00:09:07.298 --> 00:09:09.050
The trunks and the leaves

113
00:09:09.217 --> 00:09:11.719
The island gives us what we need

114
00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:13.638
And no one leaves

115
00:09:13.804 --> 00:09:15.264
That's right, we stay

116
00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:17.058
We're safe and we're well-provided

117
00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:19.143
And when we look to the future

118
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.811
There you are

119
00:09:21.437 --> 00:09:23.648
You'll be okay

120
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.608
In time you'll learn just as I did

121
00:09:25.775 --> 00:09:29.487
You must find happiness
right where you are

122
00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:39.997
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

123
00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:44.168
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

124
00:09:44.335 --> 00:09:48.256
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

125
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:52.927
But once you know what you like
Well, there you are

126
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:58.975
You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

127
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:03.437
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

128
00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:07.775
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

129
00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:11.445
Moana, that voice inside
is who you are

133

Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

134
00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:33.050
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

135
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.720
This is a sacred place.

136
00:10:35.886 --> 00:10:37.888
A place of chiefs.

137
00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:39.557
There will come a time...

138
00:10:39.724 --> 00:10:44.687
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

139
00:10:44.854 --> 00:10:47.398
Like I did. Like my father did.

140
00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:51.569
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

141
00:10:52.153 --> 00:10:53.738
And on that day...

142
00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:56.157
when you add your stone...

143
00:10:56.324 --> 00:10:59.869
you will raise this whole island higher.

144
00:11:00.202 --> 00:11:02.830
You are the future of our people, Moana.

145
00:11:02.997 --> 00:11:05.541
And they are not out there.

146
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:08.586
They are right here.

147
00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:11.922
It's time to be who they need you to be.

191
00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:34.148

darkness fell.

But, one day...

377
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.828
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

378
00:26:59.995 --> 00:27:02.914
deliver him across the great ocean...

379
00:27:03.832 --> 00:27:07.460

380
00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:12.215

389
00:27:47.417 --> 00:27:50.462

538
00:38:01.739 --> 00:38:04.909
and sail across the sea and put it back!

539
00:38:04.992 --> 00:38:06.118
Um...

540
00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:08.955
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

541
00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:11.040
which is impossible because...

542
00:38:11.207 --> 00:38:13.000
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

543
00:38:13.167 --> 00:38:15.419
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

544
00:38:15.586 --> 00:38:18.881
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

545
00:38:19.048 --> 00:38:22.426
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

546
00:38:22.593 --> 00:38:23.594
is "thank you."

547
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:25.221

- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

548
00:38:25.388 --> 00:38:26.389
What? No, no, no!

549
00:38:26.555 --> 00:38:27.890
I didn't... I wasn't...

550
00:38:28.057 --> 00:38:29.100
Why would I ever say that?

551
00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:30.476
Okay, okay.

When you were waddling yay high?

571
00:39:18.107 --> 00:39:19.233
This guy

572
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.738
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?

573
00:39:24.238 --> 00:39:26.115
You're looking at him yo

574
00:39:26.282 --> 00:39:29.952
Oh also I lassoed the sun

575
00:39:30.411 --> 00:39:31.412
You're welcome

576
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.956
To stretch your days and bring you fun

577

So what can I say except
You're welcome

581
00:39:45.092 --> 00:39:47.553
For the islands I pulled from the sea

582
00:39:48.137 --> 00:39:50.347
There's no need to pray
It's okay

583
00:39:50.514 --> 00:39:51.849
You're welcome

584
00:39:51.974 --> 00:39:55.811

Well come to think of it

588
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.235
Kid, honestly I could go on and on

589
00:40:03.652 --> 00:40:05.071
I could explain every natural phenomenon

590
00:40:05.488 --> 00:40:08.491
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around

591
00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:10.493
I killed an eel
I buried its guts

592
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:11.994
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

593
00:40:12.495 --> 00:40:13.954
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

594
00:40:14.205 --> 00:40:15.706
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

595
00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:19.043
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

596
00:40:19.502 --> 00:40:21.003
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

597

No. I'm not going to Te Fiti

00:41:22.439 --> 00:41:23.440
I'm going to get my hook.

623

You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

629
00:42:08.736 --> 00:42:11.280
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

630
00:42:11.864 --> 00:42:15.034
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

Okay. Enjoy the island.

634
00:42:45.314 --> 00:42:46.482

00:42:46.649 --> 00:42:48.067
No! Stop!

636
00:42:48.234 --> 00:42:50.152
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:06.752
(CLUCKS)

638
00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:08.420
Did not see that coming.

639
00:43:10.506 --> 00:43:13.592
I am Moana of Motunui.

640
00:43:13.759 --> 00:43:15.094
This is my canoe...

641
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:16.845

642
00:43:20.099 --> 00:43:21.725
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

643
00:43:23.852 --> 00:43:24.937
And she's back.

644
00:43:25.271 --> 00:43:27.648
I am Moana of Motunui...

645
00:43:32.695 --> 00:43:33.988
it was Moana, right?

646
00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:35.197
Yes.

647
00:43:35.656 --> 00:43:37.866
And you will restore the heart!

648
00:43:49.211 --> 00:43:50.379
All right. I'm out.

649
00:43:55.676 --> 00:43:56.885
Oh, come on!

650
00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.555
What is your problem?

651
00:44:01.307 --> 00:44:03.058
Are you afraid of it?

652
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.727
No! No.

653
00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.270
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
I'm not afraid.

654
00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:12.234
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

655
00:44:12.401 --> 00:44:13.402
You, stop it.

656
00:44:13.569 --> 00:44:16.238
That is not a heart. it is a curse.

657
00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:18.532
The second I took it, I got blasted outta the sky...

658
00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:19.867
and I lost my hook.

659
00:44:20.034 --> 00:44:21.201
Get it away from me.

660
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.037
Get this away?

661
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.164
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

662
00:44:25.331 --> 00:44:26.999
Stop that. I will smite you!

663
00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:28.834
You wanna get smote?

664
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:30.002
Smotten?

665
00:44:31.211 --> 00:44:33.672
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

666
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.549
it's a homing beacon of death.

667
00:44:35.716 --> 00:44:38.010
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

668
00:44:38.427 --> 00:44:40.179
Come for this? The heart?

669
00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:41.388
You mean this heart right here?

670
00:44:41.472 --> 00:44:42.473
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

MOANA: Yeah!

717
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:11.491
We did it!

718
00:49:13.035 --> 00:49:14.995
Congratulations on not being dead, girlie.

719
00:49:15.287 --> 00:49:16.538
You surprise me.

720
00:49:16.955 --> 00:49:18.915
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

721
00:49:20.584 --> 00:49:23.462
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

722
00:49:23.754 --> 00:49:24.963
Not to mention Te Kā.

723
00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:27.883
Lava monster?

724
00:49:28.342 --> 00:49:30.052
Ever defeat a lava monster?

725
00:49:30.719 --> 00:49:32.929
No. Have you?

726
00:49:40.437 --> 00:49:43.649
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

727
00:49:44.399 --> 00:49:47.027
You can't restore the heart without me...

728
00:49:47.194 --> 00:49:48.945
and me says no.

729
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.406
I'm getting my hook.

730
00:49:52.407 --> 00:49:53.408
End of discussion.

731
00:50:00.332 --> 00:50:02.417
You'd be a hero.

732
00:50:04.711 --> 00:50:06.797
That's what you're all about, right?

733
00:50:06.963 --> 00:50:09.800
Little girl, I am a hero.

734
00:50:09.966 --> 00:50:11.426
Maybe you were.

735
00:50:11.593 --> 00:50:12.719
But now...

736
00:50:12.886 --> 00:50:15.806
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

737
00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:18.266
The guy who cursed the world.

738
00:50:19.685 --> 00:50:21.019
You're no one's hero.

739
00:50:21.103 --> 00:50:22.354
(SCOFFS) No one?

740
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.031
But...

741
00:50:33.657 --> 00:50:35.200
put this back...

742
00:50:35.367 --> 00:50:37.119
save the world...

743
00:50:37.369 --> 00:50:39.287
you'd be everyone's hero.

744
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.129
Maui! Maui! Maui!

745
00:50:47.796 --> 00:50:49.464
You're so amazing!

746
00:50:50.048 --> 00:50:52.759
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

747
00:50:52.926 --> 00:50:54.010
Then we get your hook.

748
00:50:54.344 --> 00:50:57.889
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

749
00:50:58.056 --> 00:51:00.684
Unless you don't wanna be...

750
00:51:00.851 --> 00:51:03.979
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

751
00:51:04.146 --> 00:51:05.647
Hero to...

752
00:51:06.064 --> 00:51:07.232
all.

753
00:51:10.902 --> 00:51:12.487
First, we get my hook.

754
00:51:12.863 --> 00:51:14.239
Then save the world.

755
00:51:14.322 --> 00:51:15.323
Deal?

756
00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:16.450
Deal.

757
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:21.872
Worth a shot.

758
00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:24.708
Okay, we go east.

759
00:51:25.876 --> 00:51:27.043
To the lair of Tamatoa.

760
00:51:29.087 --> 00:51:32.674
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

761
00:51:45.187 --> 00:51:46.563
Teach me to sail.

762
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:52.235
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

763
00:51:52.402 --> 00:51:53.403
I should...

764
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.698
I should be sailing.

765
00:51:57.032 --> 00:51:58.867
It's called wayfinding, princess.

766
00:51:59.534 --> 00:52:01.411
And it's not just sails and knots...

767
00:52:01.745 --> 00:52:04.206
it's seeing where you're going in your mind.

768
00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:06.416
Knowing where you are...

769
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:08.168
by knowing where you've been.

770
00:52:08.335 --> 00:52:10.670
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

771
00:52:11.213 --> 00:52:12.297
I am the daughter of the chief.

772
00:52:12.464 --> 00:52:13.632

- Same difference.
- No.

773
00:52:13.799 --> 00:52:16.426
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

774
00:52:16.593 --> 00:52:17.719
you're a princess.

775
00:52:18.011 --> 00:52:19.095
You are not a wayfinder.

776
00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:22.682
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

777
00:52:28.021 --> 00:52:30.315
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

778
00:52:35.695 --> 00:52:38.323
You are a bad person.

779
00:52:38.698 --> 00:52:40.242
If you can talk, you can teach.

780
00:52:40.408 --> 00:52:41.409
Wayfinding.

781
00:52:42.661 --> 00:52:44.412

783
00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.250
Pull the sheet.

784
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.627
Not the sheet.

785
00:52:50.794 --> 00:52:51.795
No.

786
00:52:51.878 --> 00:52:52.879
Nope.

787
00:52:53.046 --> 00:52:55.006
Nope. No.

788
00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:57.759
Tried that one already.

789
00:53:01.137 --> 00:53:04.933
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

790
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:09.187
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

791
00:53:11.106 --> 00:53:12.607
It's cold.

792
00:53:12.774 --> 00:53:15.402
Wait, it's getting warmer. (GASPS)

The ocean?

846
00:55:52.434 --> 00:55:53.435
Makes sense.

00:55:53.518 --> 00:55:55.186

If the ocean's so smart...

851
00:56:02.027 --> 00:56:05.113
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

852
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.032
Or bring me my hook?

853

inside of a monster cave, except...

897
00:59:41.746 --> 00:59:43.331
Except...

898
00:59:43.498 --> 00:59:44.707
maybe as bait.

899
00:59:44.874 --> 00:59:46.084
Huh?

900
00:59:46.668 --> 00:59:47.835
Wow!

901
00:59:48.002 --> 00:59:50.046
The shiny, glittery cave.

902
00:59:50.213 --> 00:59:51.547
And just like me...

903
00:59:51.714 --> 00:59:54.342
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

904
00:59:54.509 --> 00:59:56.386
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

905
00:59:56.552 --> 00:59:58.012
You're not selling it!

906
00:59:58.179 --> 01:00:00.098
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

907
01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:02.725
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

908
01:00:04.936 --> 01:00:07.230
Oh, when he shows up, keep him distracted.

909
01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:08.898
Make him talk about himself.

910
01:00:09.065 --> 01:00:11.192
He loves bragging about
how great he is.

911
01:00:11.359 --> 01:00:12.860
You two must get along swell.

912
01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:15.029
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

913
01:00:15.697 --> 01:00:17.365
You ripped off his...

914
01:00:17.532 --> 01:00:18.533
Maui?

915
01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.126
(LAUGHING)

916
01:00:28.209 --> 01:00:29.544
What have we here?

917
01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:34.257
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

918
01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:35.466

919
01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.552
Ugh! It's a human!

920
01:00:37.719 --> 01:00:41.389
What are you doing down here, in the realm of the...

921
01:00:41.556 --> 01:00:42.974
Just pick an eye, babe.

922
01:00:43.141 --> 01:00:44.767
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

923
01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.228
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

924
01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:49.731
You're a funny-looking little thing, aren't you?

925
01:00:49.897 --> 01:00:51.316
Don't! That's my gramma's!

926
01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:52.567
That's my gramma's!

927
01:00:52.734 --> 01:00:53.818
I ate my gramma!

928
01:00:53.985 --> 01:00:56.446
And it took a week,
cause she was absolutely humongous.

929
01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:58.239
Why are you here?

930
01:00:59.449 --> 01:01:00.908
Cause you're amazing!

931
01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:06.414
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

932
01:01:06.581 --> 01:01:09.125
And I just had to know...

933
01:01:09.292 --> 01:01:11.836
how you became so...

934
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:14.464
crabulous?

935
01:01:15.256 --> 01:01:19.093
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

936
01:01:20.428 --> 01:01:22.138
Because if you are...

937
01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:24.349
I will gladly do so.

938
01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:25.433

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.774
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam

941
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.276
I was a drab little crab once

942
01:01:36.652 --> 01:01:39.364
Now I know I can be happy as a clam

943
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.783
Because I'm beautiful, baby

944
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.118
And did your granny say

945
01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:45.995
Listen to your heart

946
01:01:46.162 --> 01:01:48.956
Be who you are on the inside

947
01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:52.460
I need three words
To tear her argument apart

948
01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:53.961
Your granny lied

949
01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.838
I'd rather be shiny

950
01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:58.883
Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck

951
01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:02.512
Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny

952
01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:05.515
I will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck

953
01:02:06.015 --> 01:02:08.226
Just a sec
Don't ya know

954
01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:12.230
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

955
01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:13.856
Beginners

956
01:02:14.148 --> 01:02:16.484
Oh, and here they come, come, come

957
01:02:16.651 --> 01:02:18.694
To the brightest thing that glitters

958
01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:19.862
Mm, fish dinners

959
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:22.407
I just love free food

960
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.868
And you look like seafood

961
01:02:27.245 --> 01:02:29.080
MAUI: Hey, crab cake!

962
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.377
I'm back.

Giant hawk? Coming up!

967
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.097
Cheeeehoooo!

968
01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:52.103
Cheeeehoooo!

969
01:02:56.566 --> 01:02:58.401
Well, well, well.

970
01:02:58.568 --> 01:03:00.862
Little Maui's having
trouble with his look

971
01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.823
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god

972
01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:06.617
Ouch What a terrible performance

973
01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:08.202
Get the hook
Get it?

974
01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:11.080
You don't swing it
Like you used to, man

975
01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:14.709
Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start

976
01:03:14.876 --> 01:03:17.837
And your tattoos on the outside

977
01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:21.340
For just like you
I made myself a work of art

978
01:03:21.591 --> 01:03:23.551
I 'll never hide
I can't

979
01:03:23.718 --> 01:03:24.760
I'm too shiny

980
01:03:24.927 --> 01:03:27.889
Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough

981
01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:31.392
Strut my stuff
My stuff is so shiny

982
01:03:31.601 --> 01:03:34.061
Send your armies
But they'll never be enough

983
01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:36.898
My shell's too tough
Maui, man

984
01:03:38.065 --> 01:03:40.443
You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod

985
01:03:41.277 --> 01:03:43.446
To beat a decapod
Look it up

986
01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:45.406
You Will die, die, die

987
01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.408
Now it's time for me to take apart

988
01:03:48.117 --> 01:03:49.911
Your achin' heart

989
01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:54.665
Far from the ones who abandoned you

990
01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:59.504
Chasing the love of these humans

991
01:03:59.587 --> 01:04:02.632
Who made you feel wanted

992
01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:05.426
You tried to be tough

993
01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:09.639
But your armor's just not hard enough

994
01:04:10.389 --> 01:04:13.601
Maui
Now it's time to kick your heinie

995
01:04:14.435 --> 01:04:17.396
Ever seen someone so shiny

996
01:04:17.772 --> 01:04:20.691
Soak it in
Cause it's the last you'll ever see

997
01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:22.443
C'est la vie
Mon ami

998
01:04:22.652 --> 01:04:24.111
I'm so shiny

999
01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:27.073
Now I eat you so
prepare your final plea

1000
01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:28.366
Just for me

1001
01:04:29.784 --> 01:04:32.119
You'll never be quite as shiny

1002
01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:36.457
You wish you were nice and shiny

The heart of Te Fiti.

You can't run from me!

Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

We gotta go!

bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

1075
01:08:07.376 --> 01:08:08.836
I said back off.

1076
01:08:09.003 --> 01:08:10.671
Is it why your hook's not working?

1077
01:08:26.687 --> 01:08:29.440
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1078
01:08:29.857 --> 01:08:31.859
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1079
01:08:32.234 --> 01:08:33.944
throw me off.

1080
01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:37.448
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1081
01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:39.575
I know I don't.

1082
01:08:40.534 --> 01:08:43.704
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1083
01:08:43.871 --> 01:08:45.581
You're right.

1084
01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:50.211
But my island is dying...

1085
01:08:51.045 --> 01:08:54.048
so I am here.

1086
01:08:54.715 --> 01:08:57.092
It's just me and you.

1087
01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:59.929
And I want to help...

1088
01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:04.391
but I can't if you don't let me.

1089
01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:09.688
(SIGHS)

1090
01:09:09.772 --> 01:09:12.316
MAUI: I wasn't born a demigod.

1091
01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:15.110
I had human parents.

1092
01:09:17.488 --> 01:09:21.450
They took one look and decided...

1093
01:09:21.617 --> 01:09:24.078
they did not want me.

1094
01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:26.539
They threw me into the sea...

1095
01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:30.125
like I was nothing.

1096
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:35.130
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1097
01:09:35.297 --> 01:09:36.924
They gave me the hook.

1098
01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:38.759
They made me...

1099
01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:40.594
Maui.

1100
01:09:41.971 --> 01:09:44.640
And back to the humans I went.

1101
01:09:45.099 --> 01:09:48.978
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1102
01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:52.273
Anything they could ever want.

1103
01:09:52.982 --> 01:09:55.276
You took the heart for them.

1104
01:09:55.985 --> 01:09:58.863
You did everything for them.

1105
01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:01.532
So they'd love you.

1106
01:10:02.116 --> 01:10:05.286
It was never enough.

1107
01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:16.714
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1108
01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:20.050
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1109
01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:24.305
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1110
01:10:25.556 --> 01:10:29.143
But the gods aren't the ones who make you Maui.

1111
01:10:29.852 --> 01:10:31.061
You are.

1112
01:10:40.529 --> 01:10:42.364
Okay, okay.

1113
01:10:43.324 --> 01:10:45.826
I love you, too, buddy.

1114
01:11:35.668 --> 01:11:36.877
Cheeeehoooo!

1115
01:11:51.809 --> 01:11:52.810

1118
01:13:07.634 --> 01:13:09.136
I figured it out.

1119
01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:14.183
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1120
01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:18.145
cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1121
01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:21.774
All those new lands, new villages.

1122
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:24.610
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1123
01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:26.653
And if I were the ocean...

1124
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.908
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1125
01:13:31.658 --> 01:13:33.494
to start that again.

1126
01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:38.040
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1127
01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:41.210
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1128
01:13:42.836 --> 01:13:43.921
I did.

1129
01:13:46.757 --> 01:13:48.926
Moana of Motunui...

1130
01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:54.723
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1131
01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:58.352
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1132
01:13:58.811 --> 01:14:00.604
You're so amazing!

1133
01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:03.398
It's time.

1134
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.252
Go save the world.

Maui?

1149
01:16:13.028 --> 01:16:14.947
I told you to turn back.

1150
01:16:17.241 --> 01:16:18.992

We can fix it.

1154
01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:29.336

You can't fix it!

1157
01:16:34.049 --> 01:16:36.093
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1158

It's lava, it can't go in the water.

We still have to restore the heart.

My hook is cracked.

1163

One more hit, and it's over.

1164
01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:51.316

1165
01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:53.360

because you stole the heart in the first place.

1171
01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:15.382
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...
